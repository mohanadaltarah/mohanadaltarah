### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mohanad, a Software Engineer and a Content Creator from Syria with a passion for building impactful applications.  While I started my coding journey through self-exploration, I was always trying to hone my skills by tackling challenging projects. I enjoy working with Python and Django, as well as continuously building my design skills for front-end development. This portfolio showcases the projects I've built, the problems I've solved, and the lessons I've learned along the way. Get ready to see a journey of continuous learning and growth!
