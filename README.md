# Mohanad Altarah
Software Engineer | Content Creator | Lifelong Learner

Hi! I’m Mohanad — a Software Engineer and Content Creator from Syria who’s passionate about crafting impactful digital experiences.
I started my coding journey through self-exploration, constantly pushing myself with challenging projects to sharpen my problem-solving skills.

I enjoy building applications with Python and Django, while also diving deep into front-end development to bring ideas to life through clean, user-friendly designs. My work reflects a blend of technical precision and creative thinking — from backend logic to polished UI.

This space is where I share my journey of continuous growth: the projects I’ve built, the problems I’ve solved, and the lessons I’ve learned along the way.
